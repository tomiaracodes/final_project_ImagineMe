# final_project_ImagineMe
Software Carpentry Spring 2025 Project

Due to GPU restrictions, this diffusion model will not include large amount of training data and epochs. 
This model will use huggingface's Stable Diffusion as a base model, and finetuning for African book characters will be performed to provide better resolution of these characters than state-of-the-art tools.
A CSV file, created manually by author, will serve as the training data and includes Character Name, Book, Author, ISBN, Character Description, and Character ID

The scope of the project has changed to zeroing in on African characters due to the large scope of books possible.
